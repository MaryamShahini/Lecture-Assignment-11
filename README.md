1- Download the data.
2- Calculate log returns.
3- Calculate volatility measure.
4- Calculate volatility over entire length of series for various three different decay factors.
5- Plot the results, overlaying the volatility curves on the data, just as was done in the S&P example.

# Deliverable

1-Upload the Markdown file containing your code, analysis, and discussion to GitHub. Post a link to the Markdown file in the space below.
2-The markdown document should have code for entering the data, calculating log returns, calculating volatility measure, and calculating volatility for the entire series using three different decay factors.
3-Also needs to have code for a plot (and the plot itself) with the data and volatility overlaid.
4-The discussion board will talk about the differences in the volatility plots for different stocks.
